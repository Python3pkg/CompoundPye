<h2> Sensors</h2>

This tab provides an editor to modify sensor properties. You can add sensors, specify their position and properties and so on.  
Sensors can form a 'neighbourhood connection', determining which sensors are considered to be neighbours. Neurons in one column will form connections with neurons in other columns only if they are considered neighbouring columns.

<h4>Ommatidial map</h4>

Instead of specifying sensors manually, you can also hit the button `create photoreceptors using ommatidial map`. This will automatically fill the editor with photoreceptors with position and properties based on work by Geurten et al. (2014). Currently only the ommatidial map of *Drosophila melanogaster* is available.  
You can choose to include photoreceptors of one or both eyes. If you include both eyes, tangential cells (in the circuit tab) will be created twice, i.e. once for each eye.
