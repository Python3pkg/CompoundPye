This tab is all about what the agent gets to see. You can select to use a one- or two-dimensional `array` as surroundings, in which case you need to fill it with stimuli in the editor below where you can press `add stimulus` or modify previously added ones. Or you can select to use a video defining the surroundings, and specify a path to the video.  
I implemented the <b>one-dimensional</b> option very early, but ceased to use it later. Thus it is currently <b>not really supported</b>. CompoundPye is rather <b>designed to work with two-dimensional surroundings</b>. 
   
Click on a stimulus' name to edit its properties. It can be created using a `pre-defined stimulus` function, an image, or by defining an array manually. You can set several properties like `size`, `starting point` and `velocity`. In the surroundings tab, you can for each added stimuli click the `showing/hidden` button to toggle its status. This way, you can keep stimuli in the editor, you don't have to remove it if you don't want to use it in your next simulation.
