<h2> Circuit </h2>

The ciruict tab is basically an editor in which you can 

<ul>
<li> add neurons,
<li>edit a neurons properties (click on neuron's name),
<li>add a neurons connections,
<li>remove neurons.
</ul>
<br>
Since insects' compound eyes are retinotopic and columnar structured, the editor tries to capture just that: 
<ul>
<li> If you add a neuron in the tab `cells in column`, you are actually adding a neuron type, that shows up in every column. CompoundPye will create one column per sensor (can be added in the sensor tab, see next section). Only columnar neurons can receive direct input from a sensor. If you want a neuron to receive direct input from the column's sensor, click on its `connections` button, and check the box `receive input from column's sensor` in the pop-up.  <br>
A columnar neuron can have connections to itself or other neurons within the same column, or to neurons in direct vicinity of this column (neighbouring columns or neurons between this and a neighbouring column).
<li>You can add neurons in the tab `cells connecting neighbouring columns`. These are considered to be between neighbouring columns. This might not make much sense in a anatomical way (I think neurons are considered to be strictly within one column, and only their axons/dendrites stretch to neighbouring columns), but comes in very handy for the algorithm creating the complete network: for each neuron you add here, there will be one copy for each neighbourhood connection (an edge between two columns, in a graph theoretical way; more on neighbourhood in the sensor tab's help text).<br>
<li>The last category are `tangential cells`. Here, instead of neuron types of which multiple copies may exist, every neuron will be present only once (or once per eye/neighbourhood cluster). Connections thus work a bit different, and are described on a [separate page](ConnectionsOfTangentialCells) (or rather, will be described as soon as I find the time!).<br>
These cells can e.g. receive input from the same neuron type of all columns, or provide input to all neurons of a certain type in all columns.  
</ul>
